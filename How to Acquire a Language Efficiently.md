> > ## Morning Routine
> >
> > I really enjoy drinking coffee in the morning. It's like I'm getting into my comfort zone. I classify that coffee as so delicious, with no sugar, just real coffee — a great way to start your day.

> > ## Apologies for Less Travel
> >
> > What's up, guys? It's Taurus, and today I'm talking to you guys like this again.  
> > First of all, I want to apologize for not being able to travel so much lately because I've committed to something in Hong Kong. When I travel, I tend to make a lot of interesting content. But when I'm, like, kind of... I wouldn't use the word stuck in Hong Kong, but when I stay in Hong Kong, it's a lot more difficult for me to explore new things. 
> >
> > Last week, I went to Temple Street, which was very interesting, but I see this period as a great opportunity to talk to you guys, answer some of your questions, and share my thoughts. This is what my channel is all about: always exploring!

> > ## Addressing a Frequently Asked Question
> >
> > The question I want to address today is one that I've been asked so many times that I just feel the obligation to answer it:  
> > **"Taurus, how do you learn a foreign language?"**
> >
> > > **这句话是很多人问我的问题:** 塔罗斯，你是怎么学习外语的？
> >
> > This is going to be a long conversation, and I've got a lot to talk about, but I really enjoy exploring this topic because, you know, I used to be a tutor. I tutored lots of people, including many of my junior schoolmates and friends. It's a great topic to talk about because it's useful and can possibly change someone's life.

> > ## Why Learn a Foreign Language?
> >
> > Before we get into how to learn a language, let's talk about why you should learn a foreign language.
> >
> > When we were born, we were born into a little circle where everyone speaks the same language. If you're in a circle that speaks the same language, chances are they will have the same culture and do the same things. 
> >
> > By acquiring and learning a new language, you can leave your circle and migrate to someone else's circle, which is brilliant. You get to understand other people's circles.  
> > Why confine yourself to your own circle when you can explore different circles?
> >
> > > **为什么要局限在自己的圈子里，而不是去探索不同的圈子呢？**
> >
> > Always exploring! By doing that, it will really open up your eyes. For example:
> >
> > - You could go to the UK and ask people if they shower before they go to bed.
> > - You could go to France and ask French girls if they love rich Chinese guys.
> >
> > > **例如:** 你可以去英国问人们是否在睡前洗澡，或者去法国问法国女孩是否喜欢有钱的中国人。

> > ## Language Tips Disclaimer
> >
> > **Disclaimer time:** The tips I'm giving you right now will be great for improving your everyday spoken English or whatever language you're trying to learn. But I cannot guarantee you a hundred marks in your IELTS exams. I have a strong belief that language was created to communicate, not to write exams.
> >
> > > **小提示：** 语言的存在是为了交流，而不是为了应付考试。
> >
> > Learning a language to pass an exam is a whole different topic because you have to understand the system and how to get good grades. Maybe I'll explore that in a different video.

> > ## Why Listen to My Advice?
> >
> > Let me tell you why you should listen to my advice or at least take it as a reference. Just like many of you watching this video right now, I've never studied abroad, and I have never been to an international school.
> >
> > I grew up in Hong Kong and went to a local kindergarten, local primary school, and local secondary school. I only went on exchange in Dublin during university for about three months, and I also went on a working holiday in France for two months where I learned French. I was able to speak French quite fluently, or at least engage in a normal conversation.
> >
> > > **我在香港长大，去了当地的幼儿园、小学和中学。大学期间去都柏林交换了三个月，还在法国打工度假了两个月，学会了法语。**

> > ## Rule Number One: Throw Away the Dictionary
> >
> > I'm going to share with you **Rule Number One** of learning a foreign language:  
> > **Throw away the dictionary!**
> >
> > > **规则一：扔掉字典！**
> >
> > Think about this: when you were four or five months old and learning your mother tongue, did your parents give you a dictionary? The answer is no! If you answered yes, it probably means you are a genius, and you should just close this video.
> >
> > We learn through hearing. We kept hearing the same things over and over again.
> >
> > If you want to learn a language, forget about the dictionary because it's not going to work. Learning a new language should be a fun and cultural experience, not about memorizing a massive book that looks like a pillow.
> >
> > > **学习新语言应该是一个有趣的文化体验，而不是死记硬背一本像枕头一样厚的书。**
> >
> > ---
> >
> > ## Rule Number Two: Surround Yourself with Speakers
> >
> > **Tip Number Two:** Surround yourself with people who speak the language.  
> > If you want to learn English, surround yourself with English speakers. If you want to learn French, surround yourself with French people.
> >
> > > **规则二：让自己置身于说目标语言的人群中。**
> >
> > This is how you learn a language fast. You force yourself to speak. Our brain is so magical. If you force yourself to speak or listen, you will learn the language. It is that amazing!
> >
> > > **我们的头脑非常神奇，如果强迫自己去说或听，你会学会语言的。**
> >

> >
> > ## Overcoming the Fear of Making Mistakes
> >
> > The third thing I want to talk about is your mentality. If you want to do it, you can do it. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. Many people don't want to talk to foreigners because they think, "Oh, they will laugh at me because my English is so bad." 
> >
> > But think about it: when a foreign person tries to learn Mandarin or Cantonese, we love it! We think it's amazing.
> >
> > > **当外国人学习中文时，我们会觉得很棒。同样地，当我们学他们的语言时，他们也不会嘲笑我们。**
> >
> > Making mistakes is how you learn a language. It's like learning to walk; you fall and get back up again. This is how you learn to run.
> >
> > ---
> >
> > ## Final Motivation
> >
> > You are amazing by simply having the confidence and determination to learn a different language. It’s not easy, but avoid the mistake of starting strong and then giving up after two weeks. Learning a language takes at least months, and in the end, you will feel so rewarded for the effort you put in.
> >
> > So, guys, keep learning, keep making friends, and keep making mistakes — it’s very important! See you next time. Ciao!
> >
> > > **继续学习，继续交朋友，继续犯错误——这非常重要！**
